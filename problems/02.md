# 2 - Streaming a file over HTTP.

Now that we know how to stream files let's something more useful: streaming files over http.
Write a web server that streams its own source code through http.

## Tips

To write an http server, you will need the [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) core node
module.

When writing an http server, usually with `http.createServer(function (req, res) { })`, the `res` parameter
is a writable stream, so we can use the same tools we used in problem 1 to pipe the file to this stream.

You can build on the solution from the previous exercise. Here is our's:

``` js
var fs = require('fs')
var pump = require('pump')

// Any string pointing to a file on your harddrive will do, but the special
// `__filename` variable will always point to the current file (this file)

var filename = __filename
var file = fs.createReadStream(filename)

pump(file, process.stdout)
```

## Testing

To test your solution, run it with node.

```
node server.js
```

And access it via curl or a regular web browser. If your server running on port 3000, then run

```
curl localhost:3000
```
