# 3 - Share a file over TCP.

Let's go a bit more low level and share a file using just a tcp server.
Write a tcp server that shares a file to any client that connects to it.

Also, write a client that connects to it and saves the server's response to a file.

## Tips

To create TCP servers we need the [net](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html) node core module.

You can create TCP servers like this.

```js
var server = net.createServer(function (socket) {
  pump(someStream(), socket)
})

server.listen(3000)
```

To connect to a running TCP server you will neet the `net.connect` function, which connects to
the server and returns a stream.

```js
var stream = net.connect(3000, 'localhost')
```

To create a writable stream to a file checkout the `fs.createWriteStream` function.

To save the file with a temporary name, you can define the filename like this:

```js
var downloadedFilename = 'file-' + Date.now()
```

## Testing

To test your solution first run the server.

```
node server.js
```

then the client.

```
node client.js
```

And check that a file was written with the content of the file you're sharing on the server.
